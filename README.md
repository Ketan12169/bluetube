This a youtube clone made by me with the help of youtube channel 
javascript mastery 

Changes i made :
1. Same 50 vidoes get fetched when we refresh the page so made change in fetcformAPI.js set maxresults to get random int form 51 to 99 so that it fetches new videos everytime we refresh the page.
2. Added Alan AI voice assitant, We can give commands to Alan ai voice assistant like search for music videos,open video number 1, go to homepage, go to music videos, go back then it functions accordingly.
   (Currently ALAN ai is not working may be due to an issue form the alan ai website/sever)
4. Added a cool boxshadow and transform: scale property when we hover on any video, also made bluish finish to the webiste as name suggests bluetube.
